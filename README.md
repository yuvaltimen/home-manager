# Home Management Made Easy

Created following Corey Schnafer's [Django walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmljXZIypDc&list=PL-osiE80TeTtoQCKZ03TU5fNfx2UY6U4p&index=2).

This app will help to manage home affairs, including setting recurring reminders, gathering a grocery list, and more. 

## Getting Started
First, copy the `sample.env` file to a new file called `.env` and fill in the fields properly. 
The EMAIL_PASSWORD should be an app-specific password for the email account, and the WEATHER_API_KEY should 
be created from the VisualCrossing API site.
